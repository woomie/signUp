setting up for firebase
the process for auth and realtime are a bit different, for auth
you dont need an actual database so the cdn in the config file will
not include a database url so you get use the cdn from the realtime database instead

you have to attach the cdn to the index.html file and they have to be the same type
the one i have been using is the compat one if it isnt an error will occur, it has firebase.database
the others dont have that function so you might keep getting errors.

copy this to your index.html in this order
